# Masterblog-API
Creating a Blog on Python with Flask Templates and API 
and Using JWT for user authentication
## Installation
just enter `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
## Usage
To add and update posts you need to be logged in as user or admin.
As this is only for training and learning I added 2 Roles and Users:     
MaxUser with Password 'user'
and         
AdamAdmin with Password 'admin'.    
Please note that without the auth token and user you can only search and order posts
## API
The API is accessible at http://localhost:5002/api/docs
I am still working on the API Documentation I am happy for any help 
## Anotations

If you like the code feel free to use it copy it or change it...
